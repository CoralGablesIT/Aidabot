government. at the top of the page click the sign in link to join the community join an initiative q. what is an initiative? a. initiatives help to organize people, processes, and technology to meet the needs of citizens and government. together we can translate aspirations into initiatives. initiatives help government and community engage around policy, tackle pressing issues, and bring priorities into focus. you’ll be prompted to use social media or an organization (arcgis) account to join the community. there’s a faq at the bottom of the sign in with more information. on every initiative page there is a section with a button where you can follow that initiative. we are always building up more initiatives as champions and stakeholders step forward to identify common concerns on which the community and the city can collaborate.you can find initiatives in the sections above, as well as links from the hub header. look for initiatives as they are implemented. check back often

government. at the top of the page click the sign in link to join the community join an initiative q. what is an initiative? a. initiatives help to organize people, processes, and technology to meet the needs of citizens and government. together we can translate aspirations into initiatives. initiatives help government and community engage around policy, tackle pressing issues, and bring priorities into focus. you’ll be prompted to use social media or an organization (arcgis) account to join the community. there’s a faq at the bottom of the sign in with more information. on every initiative page there is a section with a button where you can follow that initiative. we are always building up more initiatives as champions and stakeholders step forward to identify common concerns on which the community and the city can collaborate.you can find initiatives in the sections above, as well as links from the hub header. look for initiatives as they are implemented. check back often

""coral gables is, perhaps, the most notable example of a modern city planned and built according to one concept and unified design. growth and development have meant here only a constant enlargement and progressive expansion of the original ideal."" ~ coral gables: its advantages for good living for healthful recreation for the enjoyment of rest or vacation -- or for profitable business or industry"" complied for the chamber of commerce, coral gables, miami, florida, 1927 returning public places back to the people over time, many of the original coral gables public spaces that were envisioned to be places for people have diminished with asphalt, high speeds, and other unfriendly traffic-related interventions. though many of these public spaces have been eroded through the past several decades that have resulted to be less accessible to people, the city of coral gables is actively addressing this need to provide quality places for people as was inherent in the original ideals and vision of merrick’s plan. quality places for people projects the city of coral gables planning and public works departments are currently focusing to work with the community and improve four important areas – coral way plazas, desoto plaza, biltmore way, and university of miami neighborhood - each unique in scale and community function. many of these projects have already gathered important ideas and feedback from the community, which is vital in restoring and transforming these places to provide a higher quality of life. coral way plazas (granada and columbus) the plazas throughout coral gables are significant features of merrick’s plan and illustrate his original vision for quality places for people. these plazas - designed as circular garden rooms - were originally planned to mark major intersections by incorporating garden walls, gateways, pergolas, and fountains. people and drivers were envisioned to equally enjoy these garden-like spaces that became the character of coral gables. however, the coral way plazas – specifically at granada and columbus – have deteriorated with the widening of asphalt for increased auto speeds and lack of maintained for pedestrian amenities. continuing to collaborate closely with the neighbors, the city can restore the original balance between pedestrians and drivers to create a quality place for people . more info desoto plaza & fountain one of the more significant and recognizable coral gables plazas is the desoto plaza, at the intersection of granada and de soto boulevard. this beautiful fountain is part of the series of public places and structures originally planned between the historic alhambra (commercial) entrance, city hall, and the biltmore hotel. similar to the other original plazas, the desoto plaza was also meant to be a balanced and garden-like space for people walking and driving to equally enjoy. the intersection, however, has changed over time to currently not fulfil merrick’s original intent of a balanced space for people to share, and is often confusing to navigate through safely. the city will start to collaborate with interested residents to restore this important monument as a quality place for people as originally envisioned. biltmore way original plans of coral gables illustrate the careful consideration of street widths, creating a purposeful hierarchy of wide boulevards for circulation that organized a network of smaller neighborhood streets. merrick had a grand vision for biltmore way, as it is a wide boulevard that provides a direct connection between the single-family neighborhoods and downtown coral gables. however throughout the last several decades, biltmore way has become less of a connection and more of a separation for people who wish to access downtown from their homes. the city is continuing to work with residents to fulfill the original vision that merrick had for this important connection as a quality place for people. more info university of miami neighborhood the immediate residential community that surrounds the university of miami is a unique single-family neighborhood with close proximity to the campus’ tropical landscape and quality community programs and events. merrick placed a great emphasis on higher education as he designed the master plan for coral gables and demonstrated this with his donation of 600 acres of land and pledge of $5 million. as the campus has developed and grown through the decades, access around the campus for residents has made these neighborhood streets uncomfortable for people. with funds provided by the university of miami, the city will continue to work together with neighbors to address current concerns in the area. contact getting involved will give you a chance to express your vision for the future of your community. tell us what you love best about the public spaces in coral gables, and help us guide the evolution of these places for people. the city welcomes your feedback and wants to hear from you. email us learn about master plans -

community vision and master plan implementation follow the flagler section one of coral gables' great trolley-served neighborhoods, bounded by sw 8th street and flagler street historical highlight the flagler section was acquired by city-founder, george merrick, and the coral gables corporation between 1924 and 1925. the new development section was considered one of the most advanced steps coral gables had taken. merrick named the neighborhood area flagler street section because it extended new development north to flagler street and expanded the miami trolley service west on flagler street to the planned, but never constructed, entrance at flagler and ponce de leon boulevard to continue south to coral way. the acquisition greatly facilitated the trolley system, locating the trolley tracts where the median on ponce de leon boulevard exists today. the flagler section originally restricted the lots fronting on ponce de leon boulevard to multi-family residences. in december of 1939, the coral gables city commission changed the zoning to allow the construction of single-family residences. some distinctive multi-family buildings were built in the mid-1920's; however, the neighborhood was not built out until the 1940's and 1950's. community vision the flagler section community vision workshop kicked-off with a walking tour to give residents the opportunity to share with the design team what they love about their community and what can continue to be improved in the neighborhood. the workshop continued with a hands-on session so that the members of the community can bring their ideas - big and small - to share with the design team, city staff, and their neighbors of how to make the flagler section an even better neighborhood for everyone. after conceptual design concepts and options were developed using the ideas and input from the neighborhood, these concepts were discussed with interested residents at a neighborhood presentation. all events presented in partnership with dover, kohl & partners. plan implementation the city budgeted preliminary engineering services in october 2019 to analyze the possible improvements to streets within the flagler section based on the 2019 community vision. this capital improvement project started in february 2020 with surveying of the streets and other public rights-of-way in the neighborhood. street design alternatives and cost estimates are being finalized and will be presented and discussed with the neighborhood in winter 2020/2021 or once it is safe to conduct in-person community meetings. follow

https://coral-gables-planning-cggis.hub.arcgis.com/,master planning in coral gables,"skip navigation * sign in explore * events * data * documents * apps & maps * find * sign in follow master planning in coral gables coral gables is a rare and unique community because of the completeness of its original concept and plan, heavily based on the early twentieth century city beautiful movement. master planning remains an important aspect of the city to create a high quality of life in an evolving community. coral gables was developed by george merrick during the florida land boom of the 1920s. the city's architecture is almost entirely mediterranean revival style, mandated by the original plan. the city's urban core and downtown was designed to be walkable with only four blocks wide and and transit-served for more than two miles long with the ponce de leon trolley. how you plan your community a master plan is an overarching planning document that provides a long-term road map to guide future growth and development. some master plans may need to be updated between ten and thirty years, depending on the growth and demographics of the community. it starts with ideas and input from the community that creates a vision for a neighborhood, district, or city which is later implemented by one or more projects. * public participation the best master plans are created from the ideas and active involvement from the neighbors and stakeholders of the local community. multiple techniques may be used to collect public feedback, from hands-on table groups to one-on-one conversations. * conceptual designs based on the ideas and input gathered from the community and stakeholders, conceptual designs are produced. the concepts may include alternatives or scenarios that account for the future, with preliminary costs. * community vision a community's distinctive vision incorporates the ideas from the community that may include a variety of topics and disciplines, from land use to historic preservation to increased mobility options. * adoption of plan the draft master plan is presented with the community input, vision, and conceptual designs to interested and relevant boards. the city commission adopts the master plan with a preliminary timeline for implementation. ""effective planning is compounded of vision and the proper application of that vision."" ~ george merrick, visionary and founder of coral gables, 1927 how your community's master plan is built the implementation of a master plan may be built as a single capital improvement project or several individual projects to fulfill the desires of the community. * capital project selection before the start of each fiscal year in october, the city commission selects a range of capital improvement projects as supported by the strategic plan and other master plans. * design development with an approved budget, the conceptual designs are developed and assessed to be feasible based on initial design concepts presented to the community during the creation of the plan. * update to community the developed designs and estimated schedule is finalized and presented to the community and stakeholders. * project construction with the funds allocated in the project's budget, the specific capital improvement project is designed and built according to the community vision. town planning in coral gables ""coral gables is, perhaps, the most notable example of a modern city planned and built according to one concept and unified design. growth and development have meant here only a constant enlargement and progressive expansion of the original ideal."" ~ coral gables: its advantages for good living for healthful recreation for the enjoyment of rest of vacation - or for profitable business or industry"" complied for the chamber of commerce, coral gables, miami, florida, 1927 coral gables, ""miami's master suburb"" town plan, showing original design of plazas, october 1921. image credit: historymiami coral gables, ""miami's master suburb"" town plan, showing original design of the granada golf course, october 1921. image credit: historymiami coral gables, ""miami's suburb distinctive"" town plan july 1921. image credit: historymiami early town plans for the design of coral gables addressed the need for open space, civic space, and a variety of street types. this 1921 drawing by w.c. bliss and frank button shows plans for a proposed ""electric railroad,"" or streetcar, running along alhambra circle, the granada golf course fronted by home sites, and the coral gables club house at the corner of north greenway drive and granada boulevard. it also shows the plazas along coral way, which remain a notable part of coral gables today. the original deeds to the lots in coral gables included numerous restrictions, including architectural style, building setbacks, fence types, and street frontage. many of these restrictions were incorporated into the zoning code, and today they are located in appendix a, site specific regulations. (other regulations have also been incorporated into appendix a over the years.) george merrick controlled the street frontage of buildings along major streets in order to create a consistent character for people passing by. the character of public space in coral gables was carefully designed, from the width of streets to the creation of unique plazas, parks, and civic buildings. the town plan of july 1921 shows the original design for ponce de leon plaza on coral way, just a block west of the merrick house. note the concept of simple curved walls anchored by piers. the design was further refined in the october 1921 plan, which includes a wider right-of-way around ponce de leon plaza to create a greater feeling of openness. the town plan of july 1921 also shows the careful consideration of street widths, creating a hierarchy of grand 100' wide boulevards for circulation and for displaying big house on large lots, to smaller 60' wide streets fronted by lots with more modest homes. ""cordova, an old palace"" lesser known architecture of spain, 1925 h. george fink office, 1925 a spanish village ""in beautiful and simple construction, in arches and in masses, in design which makes everything harmonious, the architects of coral gables have followed the great masters, have rooted their work in with the roots of the greatest."" ~ coral gables miami riviera, 1923 the architects of the 1920s drew their inspiration from travel and from books. george merrick and his team of architects decided that spanish, and later mediterranean architecture, adapted to the south florida climate, was the ideal character for the new town of coral gables. in order to develop a new architecture that evoked the character of spain, architects relied on books of photos and drawings of spain and the mediterranean. these books were a standard part of an architect's library during this time. ""always it seemed to me that there should be the same class of houses and surroundings which were along the shores of the mediterranean. geographically and climatically, south florida is identified with spain, north africa, and all that lies between them and the south sea islands."" ~george merrick, 1925 development history of coral gables coral gables began as a small plantation of 160 acres, five miles west of miami. visionary george merrick and landscape architect, frank m. button, master planned coral gables far beyond the typical concepts of subdivisions of housing within a gridiron pattern of streets. the original plan for coral gables consisted of 1200 acres, starting with the platting of 'section a' in 1921, and established coral way as the major east-west axis and granada boulevard as the major north-south axis. the first stage of growth, 1921 through 1925, consisted mostly north of bird road, even as other development sections were platted to the south. the second stage of growth were portions of the riviera section and the university of miami - a critically important aspect in merrick's vision. the third stage was never realized due to the hurricane of 1926. ""on all the principal boulevards at coral gables have been laid out delightful parks, plazas and rest spots... whenever possible fruit trees in the parkways between sidewalks and streets have been preserved, and for miles the visitor to coral gables walks through veritable bowers laden with delectable fruit."" ~ frank m. button, 1921 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 ""coral gables was the center of the most spectacular real estate promotion in the history of our country. the city was planned on a scale adequate for a population of more than a quarter of a million."" ~ financial and administrative survey of the city of coral gables municipal consultant service of the national municipal league, 1934 past public workshops the city of coral gables continues to work along side citizens and stakeholders in various parts of the city to create a vision for the local community. ""a well planned city, beautiful homes, widest range of scholastic activities, with the material, the communal, the municipal and the cultural phases of life fittingly rounded out by those religious organizations, so especially a part of the foundation of american life and outlook - the whole developing a highly conscious citizenship. that is coral gables."" ~ george merrick, coral gables facts,

implementation of development, planning, transportation, housing, and environment policies, in order to maintain the city as a safe, vital and attractive community and enhance the high quality of

engaged citizens, urban planners, architects, engineers, businesses, and others—regardless of background or skillset—are invited to participate in the competition. in order to provide an opportunity for direct impact on the quality of life in coral gables, solutions submitted through this competition will have a chance to become integrated into the coral gables smart city hub. find more information about the smart city hub by visiting: coralgables.com/smartcity. teams will compete over a 3-month period, affording networking opportunities and the chance to make a difference. diversity of backgrounds leads to innovation, therefore, the formation of multidisciplinary teams is encouraged. the challenge the competition will be focused on 5 specific sub-problems under the general domain of transportation and traffic. the city aims to improve the quality of life for its citizens and visitors who are travelling by car, via public transportation, or on foot. teams may choose to focus their solution on 1 of these 5 sub-problems: 1. commercial trucks in the coral gables downtown area (parking, blocking, traffic congestion, blocking alleys, loading zone violations, public safety issues, pedestrian/bike conflicts). 2. parking (availability, efficiency, finding parking in downtown and other areas). 3. environmental sustainability of transportation solutions (carbon emissions, air quality, noise pollution, adoption of evs, etc.). 4. public safety related issues (pedestrian and bicyclist safety, etc.); encouraging walking/cycling in coral gables, including making these modes safer for all users. 5. speed safety in neighborhoods: a. provide data to residents on speeding in their neighborhood, which can be used to justify traffic-calming devices (iot devices that measure speed and detect license plates / a variety of technologies that work together / cheaper, faster iot). b. waze data partnership providing real-time-incidents data such as: accidents, traffic jams, construction. c. real-time actionable maps for first responders (quicker turn around for speed studies done by officers). resources to gain a deeper understanding of the technology and sustainability priorities, plans, and up-to-date success stories for the city of coral gables, the following resources are available: * smart city engineering and design poster (pictured at right) * smart city plan
